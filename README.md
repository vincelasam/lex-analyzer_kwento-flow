# KwentoFlow Lexical Analyzer

A lexical analyzer (tokenizer) for **KwentoFlow**, a Domain-Specific Language that combines narrative structure with secure middleware logic for web applications.

## 📖 About KwentoFlow

KwentoFlow is a narrative-driven programming language designed to solve broken access control issues in web development. It treats programs as stories with:
- **Scenes** - State machines representing moments in the narrative
- **Characters** - Dual-purpose constructs serving as both data structures and security principals
- **Transitions** - State changes that move the story forward
- **Perceives** - Built-in row-level security and field masking

## 🎯 Project Overview

This lexical analyzer is the first phase of the KwentoFlow. It converts raw source code into a stream of tokens that will be consumed by the parser.
